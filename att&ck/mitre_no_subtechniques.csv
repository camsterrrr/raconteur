Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate'
T1195,Supply Chain Compromise,'Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.'
T1218,System Binary Proxy Execution,'Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed'
T1082,System Information Discovery,'An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware'
T1614,System Location Discovery,'Adversaries may gather information in an attempt to calculate the geographical location of a victim host. Adversaries may use the information from System Location Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors'
T1016,System Network Configuration Discovery,'Adversaries may look for details about the network configuration and settings'
T1049,System Network Connections Discovery,'Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network.'
T1033,System Owner/User Discovery,'Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user'
T1216,System Script Proxy Execution,'Adversaries may use trusted scripts'
T1007,System Service Discovery,'Adversaries may try to gather information about registered local system services. Adversaries may obtain information about services using tools as well as OS utility commands such as sc query'
T1569,System Services,'Adversaries may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. Adversaries can execute malicious content by interacting with or creating services either locally or remotely. Many services are set to run at boot'
T1529,System Shutdown/Reboot,'Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to'
T1124,System Time Discovery,'An adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone settings from a local or remote system. The system time is set and stored by services'
T1080,Taint Shared Content,'Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations'
T1221,Template Injection,'Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts. For example'
T1205,Traffic Signaling,'Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response'
T1537,Transfer Data to Cloud Account,'Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data'
T1127,Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution,'Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads. There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development'
T1199,Trusted Relationship,'Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.'
T1552,Unsecured Credentials,'Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system'
T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,'Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection. Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.'
T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,'Adversaries may use alternate authentication material'
T1204,User Execution,'An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by'
T1078,Valid Accounts,'Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access'
T1125,Video Capture,'An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g.'
T1497,Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,'Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME'
T1600,Weaken Encryption,'Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications.'
T1102,Web Service,'Adversaries may use an existing'
T1047,Windows Management Instrumentation,'Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads. WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows systems. WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.'
T1220,XSL Script Processing,'Adversaries may bypass application control and obscure execution of code by embedding scripts inside XSL files. Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations'
